## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
 
### What I learned

I've learned a lot while working on this project from several sides. From layout side like depending on css flex in everything. From positioning side while creating the background. From "learning a new" side, I decided to learn SASS and apply it in this challenge. And finally, from logic side, trying to do my best to write less lines in JS.

It was really benefitting.

### Continued development

I'll continue learning more about SASS to use it in my next challenges

### Useful resources

- [Attacomsian: How to convert NodeList to an Array](https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-convert-nodelist-to-array) - This article contains several ways, I decieded to it with ```Array.prototype.slice``` method.

- [Elzero Web School: SASS Course (In Arabic)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzlpyFHOaB3b-eubmF0TAV2) - This is really amazing course, I learned SASS [SCSS] from it. 
**Note: the course is in Arabic language**
